Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of shapes and spaces that do not change under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, or bending. It is a fundamental subject that has many applications in geometry, analysis, algebra, physics, computer science, and more.
 
The book Topology, by James Munkres, 2nd edition, is one of the most popular and widely used textbooks on topology. It covers topics such as set theory and logic, topological spaces and continuous functions, connectedness and compactness, countability and separation axioms, the Tychonoff theorem, metrization theorems and paracompactness, complete metric spaces and function spaces, and Baire spaces and dimension theory. It also includes many exercises that test and reinforce the concepts and techniques learned in each chapter.
 
However, finding solutions to these exercises can be challenging, especially if you are studying on your own or do not have access to a teacher or a tutor. Fortunately, there are some online resources that provide solutions to some or all of the exercises from the book. Here are some of them:
